# jarvide-api
The API for interacting with user files

This API is not meant for public use (as of now). We may expose public endpoints later on. For now, while the endpoints are technically public,
you will need the authorization key to access any endpoints.

# Technologies
As of right now, the only technologies in use are:
  - Node.js
  - Prisma
  - Express.js
